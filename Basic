Write first code:  //Just a rough guide
  Install iverilog
  add path to environment variables
  
  create a file(.txt) with instructions(for basics just print "hello world") and .v extension
  run CMD from the bin folder of iverilog(folder containing iverilog.exe)
  run the command: iverilog.exe -o <obj_file_name_path> <file_name_path>
  this will compile the code and create an object file,
  run the command: vvp <object_name>
  this will run the compiled file and display the hello world in the CMD

With a testbench:

  write a deign file and its testbench
  open CMD from the bin
  run the command: iverilog.exe -o <obj_filename> <testbench_name> <design_name>
  run the command: vvp <obj_filename>
  this will display the results in CMD

For GTK Waveforms:

  the testbench file should have a $dumpfile("<filename>");
  use this name with the following command:
  gtkwave.exe <filename>
